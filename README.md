# Discord Account Nuker

This script is a **selfbot** tool available in both Python and JavaScript. It automates destructive actions such as deleting friends, leaving/deleting guilds, and removing direct messages (DMs) from your Discord account using **direct API calls** via `axios` (for JavaScript) or `aiohttp` (for Python). It logs all activities and provides a user-friendly interface with multiple options. **Use with caution** as this script is designed for account nuking and violates Discord's Terms of Service.

## Features (Both Python and JavaScript)

- **Account Info Display**: Fetch and display information about your Discord account, including payment methods and subscriptions.
- **Guild Management**: Automatically leave or delete Discord guilds depending on ownership status.
- **Friend Removal**: Mass remove all friends from the account.
- **DM Deletion**: Close and delete all direct messages.
- **Full Nuke**: Execute all of the above actions in sequence, effectively wiping the account's presence on Discord.

## Confirmation Prompt

Before performing any destructive action, the script prompts the user to confirm the action by typing "Confirm". If the user types "Cancel", the operation will be aborted and the script will return to the main menu. This provides an additional layer of security to prevent unintended data loss.

### Logging

All activities are logged into the `account_nuker.log` file. Each action is recorded with details like the number of friends removed, guilds left or deleted, DMs closed, and any errors encountered.

### Rate Limits

Both scripts handle rate limiting with automatic retries if Discord API limits are hit during operations such as removing friends or leaving guilds.

## Notes

- **Selfbots are against Discordâ€™s Terms of Service**. Use this tool responsibly and be aware of the potential consequences, such as your account being banned.
- This script uses **direct API calls** in selfbot mode, meaning it logs in as a user account rather than a bot account.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for managing roles and permissions.
- Option to handle individual guild actions (e.g., selectively leave or delete).
- More customization for logging and output.
