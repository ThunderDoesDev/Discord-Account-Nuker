# Discord Account Nuker

This script is a selfbot tool that automates destructive actions such as deleting friends, leaving/deleting guilds, and removing direct messages (DMs) from your Discord account. It logs all activities and provides a user-friendly interface with multiple options. **Use with caution** as this script is designed for account nuking and may violate Discord's Terms of Service.

## Features

- **Account Info Display**: Fetch and display information about the user's Discord account, including payment methods and subscriptions.
- **Guild Management**: Automatically leave or delete Discord guilds depending on ownership status.
- **Friend Removal**: Mass remove all friends from the account.
- **DM Deletion**: Close and delete all direct messages.
- **Full Nuke**: Execute all of the above actions in sequence, effectively wiping the account's presence on Discord.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) (`pip install discord.py`)
- [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) (`pip install aiohttp`)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) (`pip install tqdm`)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThunderDoesDev/Discord-Account-Nuker.git
    cd Discord-Account-Nuker
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install discord.py aiohttp tqdm
    ```

3. Open the script `account_nuker.py` and run it.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python account_nuker.py
    ```

2. Enter your **Discord token** when prompted. To find your token, follow these [instructions](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/).

3. Select an option from the menu:
    - **1**: Show account information.
    - **2**: Leave or delete guilds.
    - **3**: Remove all friends.
    - **4**: Delete all DMs.
    - **5**: Perform a full nuke (executes all actions).

### Logging

All activities are logged into the `account_nuker.log` file. Each action is recorded with details like the number of friends removed, guilds left or deleted, DMs closed, and any errors encountered.

### Confirmation

Before executing destructive actions, the script will ask for confirmation to prevent accidental execution. Simply type **Confirm** to proceed or **Cancel** to return to the main menu.

### Rate Limits

The script handles rate limiting with automatic retries if Discord API limits are hit during operations such as removing friends or leaving guilds.

## Notes

- **Selfbots are against Discordâ€™s Terms of Service**. Use this tool responsibly and be aware of the potential consequences, such as your account being banned.
- This script uses **discord.py** in selfbot mode, meaning it logs in as a user account rather than a bot account.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for managing roles and permissions.
- Option to handle individual guild actions (e.g., selectively leave or delete).
- More customization for logging and output.
